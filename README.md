# Bridgit frontend code challenge

## Running the app

1. Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. Please do not push changes to this repository.

2. Clone the repository to your dev environment.

3. Install the required dependencies.

```
yarn
```

4. Run the application.

```
yarn start
```

## The challenge

Implement a react application that allows users to manage a list of categorized items. The application should have the following features:

1. Allow users to create item entries by providing an item name, a category to which the item belongs and a price. Make sure to validate that the value provided for the price is an actual dollar value.
2. Allow users to view the list of items in a tabular manner.
3. Allow users to remove items from the list.
3. Allow users to filter the list of items displayed by category.
4. Allow users to sort the list of items by name, category and price.

Please make sure to document your code.

## Avaliable tools

We've added `react-redux`, `Redux Devtools` and `Material UI` as part of this template for you to use. Feel free to use them if they make things easier for you.

## Example

This example is just one way in which the application could be implemented. Feel free to use this as the base for your implementation or use your creativity to come up with your own approach.
