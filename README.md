# Bridgit frontend code challenge

## Running the app

1. Fork the repository if you have a GitHub account. Please do not push changes to this repository.

2. Clone the repository to your dev environment.

3. Install the required dependencies.

```
yarn
```

4. Run the application.

```
yarn start
```

## The challenge

Implement a react application that allows users to manage a list of categorized items. The application should have the following features:

1. Allow users to create item entries by providing an item name, a category to which the item belongs and a price. Make sure to validate that the value provided for the price is an actual dollar value.
2. Allow users to view the list of items in a tabular manner.
3. Allow users to remove items from the list.
3. Allow users to filter the list of items displayed by category.
4. Allow users to sort the list of items by name, category and price.

Note that these requirements are in order of priority. We think the challenge should not take more than four hours to complete so don't spend too much time on it.

## Avaliable tools

We've added `react-redux`, `Redux Devtools` and `Material UI` as part of this template for you to use. Feel free to use them if they make things easier for you.

## Example

This example is just one way in which the application could be implemented. Feel free to use this as the base for your implementation or use your creativity to come up with your own approach.

# Notes

At the top level of the directory structure you can find a file named `NOTES.md`. Please feel free to add there any notes related to the implementation of your code. Some things that we would be interested in are:

* Assumptions you made during the implementation process.
* Known limitations of your implementation.
* What you liked or didn't like.
* The challenges you encountered.
* Anything else you'd like to add.

# Deliverables

You can either provide us with a link to your fork of the repository or you can zip up your local repository and send it to us. If you opt for the latter option please make sure to exclude the `node_modules` directory from your zip file.
